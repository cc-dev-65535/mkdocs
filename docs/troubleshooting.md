### I set the wrong key binding and want to revert it
From the keyboard shortcut editor you can filter all key bindings by user-defined bindings to list all the key bindings that you have personally set. From this list you can right click any user-defined key binding and remove or reset it.

### I want to delete a snippet as it is no longer useful


### I can't find my desired key binding through the keyboard shortcut editor
If the search function in the keyboard shortcut editor is not helpful for finding a key binding then you should refer to method 2 in the "Setting Custom Key Bindings" section. This method will work for all possible key bindings in VS Code provided you know what clauses to enter into the JSON file.

### I accidently imported the wrong profile
Reset your system settings to the default.
