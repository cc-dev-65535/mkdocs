### I set the wrong key binding and want to revert it
From the keyboard shortcut editor you can filter all key bindings by user-defined bindings to list all the key bindings that you have personally set. Click the **...** in the top right of the shortcut editor and then **Show User Keybindings** from the menu to see the list. From this list you can right click on any user-defined key binding and remove or reset it. Alternatively, you can edit the JSON file with key bindings directly.

### I want to remove a snippet as it is no longer useful
Follow the steps in the **Making Code Snippets** section to open the snippet file for your desired programming language and simply delete the snippet (JSON object) you added from this file.

### I can't find my desired key binding through the keyboard shortcut editor
If the search function in the keyboard shortcut editor is not helpful for finding a key binding then you should refer to **method 2** in the **Setting Custom Key Bindings** section. This method will work for all possible key bindings in VS Code provided you know what command identifiers to enter into the "command" clause.

### I accidentally imported the wrong profile
Reset your system settings to the default.
